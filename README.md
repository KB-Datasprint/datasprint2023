# Datasprint 2023 - Digitised Cultural Heritage of the Enligthenment

Download data together with Orange workflows from this direct link: https://sciencedata.dk/shared/73057819d465f7c6b906ce0f84d40767?download  

For the datasprint, we have selected three Danish cultural history data sets:
- The Writings of the Freedom of the Press
- Literature from the collection of the Royal Danish Library
- The National Census from 1787

We have decide to use the Datasprint to get an understanding about who humanists will work with and use Orange to produce four to five graphs and use the graphs when to answer a research question. Orange is an excellent, open source programme with a large potential in many ways. If you know how to use it, then you can - without having to programme - solve many computer-based analysis tasks of both literature and tabular data.
